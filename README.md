# Working: 
Text classification using Naive Bayes is a popular and effective technique in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. This method is particularly useful for categorizing text data into predefined classes or categories.

Data Preparation: The first step is to collect and preprocess the text data. This involves cleaning the text by removing punctuation, stop words, and other noise. Then, the text is usually tokenized into words or n-grams (contiguous sequences of n words).

Feature Extraction: Next, features are extracted from the text data. In the case of Naive Bayes, these features are often term frequencies (how many times each word appears in a document) or term frequencies-inverse document frequencies (TF-IDF), which take into account both the frequency of a term in a document and its importance in the entire dataset.

Training: A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on a labeled dataset. During training, the algorithm calculates the conditional probability of each feature (word or n-gram) given each class label (category). This involves estimating the likelihood of observing a particular feature in documents belonging to each class.

Classification: Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new, unseen text data. When a document needs to be categorized, the model calculates the probability of the document belonging to each class based on the features present in the document. The class with the highest probability is assigned as the predicted category.

Evaluation: The performance of the Naive Bayes classifier is typically assessed using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset. This helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
